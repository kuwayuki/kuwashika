Thanks for a lot.
I answered this question.
Please check following.

Q1.

> We're looking forward to completing our review, but we need more information to continue. Your app uses the AppTrackingTransparency framework, but we are unable to locate the App Tracking Transparency permission request when reviewed on iOS 15.2.1.

> If you've implemented App Tracking Transparency but the permission request is not appearing on devices running the latest OS, please review the available documentation and confirm App Tracking Transparency has been correctly implemented.

Thanks.
So I updated app to confirm App Tracking Transparency.

Q2.

- Tracking is linking data collected from your app with third-party data for advertising purposes, or sharing the collected data with a data broker. Learn more about tracking.
- See Frequently Asked Questions about the new requirements for apps that track users.
- Review developer documentation for App Tracking Transparency.

Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed

We have started our review, but we need additional information to continue. Specifically, it appears your app may access or include paid digital content or services, and we want to understand your business model before completing our review.

Sorry I don't need this yet.
So I deleted that paid subscriptions.

Q3.
We noticed that the app name to be displayed on the App Store and the app name displayed on the device do not sufficiently match, which makes it difficult for users to find the app they just downloaded. The app names are:

- Name on the App Store: ペリオチャート

- Name displayed on the device: PeriodontalInspection

A3.
I Changed displayed name PeriodontalInspection to PerioChart.
